1. THE VIBE CLAUSE
   You acknowledge that this software was created in a flow state, through
   conversational iteration with an AI, while the author was "just seeing
   what happens." The code works. We're not entirely sure why. Don't ask.

2. NO WARRANTY, BUT GOOD ENERGY
   THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
   IMPLIED. However, it was made with good intentions and positive energy.
   If it breaks, take a deep breath and try again.

3. ATTRIBUTION OF VIBES
   When redistributing, you may optionally credit "the vibes" or acknowledge
   that the code "just kind of came together, you know?"

4. THE FUCK IT CLAUSE
   If something doesn't work, you are permitted to mutter "fuck it" and try
   a different approach. This is expected behavior, not a bug.

5. CONTEXT LOSS DISCLAIMER
   The authors may have forgotten why certain decisions were made. Comments
   like "// don't touch this" or "// it works now" are legally binding.

6. AI COLLABORATION NOTICE
   Portions of this software were pair-programmed with Claude. Neither party
   fully understands the other's contributions, and that's fine.

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES, OR OTHER
LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, ARISING
FROM, OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE VIBES THEREOF.

For the lawyers: This is functionally equivalent to the MIT License with
extra words. Use it however you want. We're chill.
